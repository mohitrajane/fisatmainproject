\section{Overview}
The mathematical roots of the idea of fractals have been traced through a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century, and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 21st century.

The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laypeople than mathematicians, where the layperson is more likely to be familiar with fractal art than a mathematical conception. The mathematical concept is difficult to formally define even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over. Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the infinite regress in parallel mirrors or the homunculus, the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head...).

\section{Problem Statement}

\par In the current education system students are taught to learn formulas and how to use them but not to reason or understand the logic behind them, causing then to forget it in a short peroid.It is a typical longitudianl learning approah. Our brain system is not just longitudianl in learning process, but much more complex. Current education system evolved on the basis of visual and audotory senses and their application leads to memmorizing the content of learning rather than creaing a holistic perceprtion.
% which can be based on the enormous untapped abilities of the human brain.
It is observed that the current education system  uses mainly audio methods to teach students.
In India around 10\% of students suffer from some form of learning disibility[1]. Research also point to the fact that visual working memory is better in students with learning disibility rather than audority working memory[2].
It can be infered that a modern method of learning should be devloped in order to increase the efficiency of learning process.

\par To addres this issue  we propose a system which uses a hologramic display with haptic feedback by the interaction of using hand gestures. This project will focus on developing a system as described above to introduce a new approch to learn basic geometry.

\section{Objective}

To create a system which also includes somesthetic senses to learning. To achive this a hologramic display with haptic feedback is proposed. The proposed system can be used to project objects in mid-air which can be intracted by using the hand gestures to view new objects, change or modifiy its properties like size, view etc.

\chapter{Literature Review}

The world population is the sum of all humans on Earth. As of today, it is estimated to number 7.004 billion by the United States Census Bureau. The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12, 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations Population Fund, it reached this milestone on October 31, 2011.
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Rank & Country & Population  & Percentage  \\ 
\hline 1 & China & 1,347,350,000 & 19.24\% \\ 
\hline 2 & India & 1,210,193,422  & 17.28\% \\ 
\hline 3 & United States & 313,269,000 & 4.47\% \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{World Population Table} 
\end{center}
\end{table}
The world's population is unevenly distributed, with six of Earth's seven continents being permanently inhabited on a large scale. As of 2012, Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.1 billion inhabitants accounting for over 60\% of the world population. The world's two most-populated countries alone, China and India, constitute about 37\% of the world's population. Africa is the second-most-populated continent, with around 1 billion people, or 15\% of the world's population. Europe's 733 million people make up 11\% of the world's population, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to 589 million (9\%).


\chapter{Design}

Hologram was selected as research has shown learning gemotry with hologram is better than tradional methods[3].With the current technology it is possible to add the usage of somesthetic senses to learning.


In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation:
$$
a^{n} + b^{n} = c^{n}
$$ 
for any integer value of n greater than two 

This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, famously in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. No successful proof was published until 1995 despite the efforts of countless mathematicians during the 358 intervening years. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th. It is among the most famous theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its 1995 proof was in the Guinness Book of World Records for "most difficult mathematical problems".

\section{Proposal}
In mathematics, Stirling's approximation (or Stirling's formula) is an approximation for large factorials. It is named after James Stirling.

The formula as typically used in applications is:

$$
\ln (n!) = n \ln n - n  + O(\ln(n))
$$

\chapter{Conclusion}

An intrusion detection system (IDS) \cite{nist} is a device or software application that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to a Management Station.


Donald Ervin Knuth \cite{knuth} is a computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the seminal multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. Knuth has been called the "father" of the analysis of algorithms
